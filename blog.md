Introduction

Always look towards the future, and with the everyday advancements in our society it isn’t that hard to see the future. There are many scholars who explain how we should advance in certain fields. One example can be the advancement of the Digital Humanities. Although many people will influence the direction we advance in the digital humanities scholarship, Drucker and Moretti will definitely be a big influence because of their respective works that present a better understanding of how digital humanities scholarship should progress for the next generation. AS they give a refined meaning to what digital scholarships are and what the future should hold for it. Throughout this blog post I will explain how Drucker and Moretti’s readings influenced the advancement of digital scholarships along with my opinion on it, what their respective works did to define digital scholarships and where i believe digital scholarships will go from here.

They’ve Got a Point
Both Drucker and Moretti in their respective readings talk about how visual representations should be used to any occurring cultural phenomena. In my opinion, i agree with their theory as we live in a world where people need visual evidence for something to be believable. When comparing both readings it's noted they never really explain how we should incorporate digital scholarships. But, they did suggest ways in which they can visually represent data. 

Drucker’s reading went into great detail about breaking down visual tools and mending them to be able to use capta to see what visual tools are really trying to show. As i was reading his his work, i stumbled onto an interesting quote:

To expose the constructedness of data as capta a number of systematic changes have to be applied to the creation of graphical displays. That is the foundation and purpose of a humanistic approach to the qualitative display of graphical information. Read that last formulation carefully, humanistic approach means that the premises are rooted in the recognition of the interpretative nature of knowledge, that the display itself is conceived to embody qualitative expressions, and that the information is understood as graphically constituted. (Drucker, para. 9)

I found this quote very interesting because he kind of explains the process which he believes needs to be fulfilled to really visually represent data. Although the example that Drucker provided isn’t really the way we visually represent capta and data nowadays. But even though people of today don’t break down their visual aid like Drucker suggests, he did leave an imprint in giving people the ideology that we should mend our visual tools to represent our capta.

Moretti’s reading explained the idea of showing a wider variety of variables to show better trends. Not only was it evident that Moretti used a variety of variables but he used various models to represent his data. Moretti had a peculiar gem of a quote in his work:

"I began this article by saying that quantitative data are useful because they are independent of interpretation; then, that they are interesting because they demand an interpretation; and now, most radically, we see them challenge existing interpretations(Moretti, 91)"

It was interesting to see ho Moretti changed his state of mind while doing this piece because he learned that quantitative data is open to interpretation 

##Use of Analyzation and Visualization
We have many tools for text analysis and visualization at our disposal with the technology we have today. An example of one of these tools is Voyant. “Voyant Tools is a web-based text reading and analysis environment. It is a scholarly project that is designed to facilitate reading and interpretive practices for digital humanities students and scholars as well as for the general public.”(Voyant-Tools) This tool was made with the intention of giving a tool assist those in the digital humanities. Voyant allows users to view trends in text with key words while being able to see the trending data mapped in a graph or other various methods.

This interactive trend graph made from voyant is a great example of how digital scholarship tools can boost the appeal and quality of one’s work through the interactive evidence it provides. For example, in the graph we can compare the use of certain words in the two texts that I want to analyze and see how often its used in each text. I can even remove words to compare other words more closely.

##Where do we go from here
	Digital humanities is such a huge field that stems out to many different skill sets and unique attributes. One of these stems is one of these branches and is proving that it serves well to be used in todays’ world and the future to come. Although we can’t ensure how digital scholarship will be utilized in the future we can be certain that it should without a doubt be highly useful in the future and we can thank Drucker and Moretti for trying to push digital scholarship forward.
